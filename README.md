It's a Python project that involves running a server and two clients. Each client controls a square, and the squares move around on the server. One client uses data transfer through strings, while the other sends objects through pickle. In the server and network files, replace the IP address with the local IP address of the device that will run the programs. This will only work if both clients are on the same network as the IP.

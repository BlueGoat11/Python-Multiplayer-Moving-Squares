This is a Python project in which you run the server, and then run two clients. There are two squares that move around and you control one on each client. The folder (With Strings) Uses data transfer through strings, and the other sends objects through pickle. Where the IP address is on the server and network files, replace that with your own local IP of the device you want it to run on (The one running the programs). This will only work if the two clients are on the same network as the IP.
